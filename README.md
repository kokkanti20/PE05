# input

 User interactions with the online interface comprise the input for the Recipe Finder app.  Users may modify a particular recipe, browse current ones, or contribute a new one.  Text entries for the recipe name and ID, which the user supplies through forms on the Add Recipe and Edit Recipe pages, are inputs.

 # Process

 After getting the input, React's component-based architecture helps the app process the data.  The software activates a feature updating the state and storing the data locally when the user enters a recipe.  Whether it's showing the homepage or finding the recipe-edit page, the React Router guides users to the relevant page.  Dynamic manipulation and display of recipe data depends on user action and current path.

# Output

 The produced page showing user interaction outcomes is the output of the program.  On the Home page the user can view a list of all recipes, the form to add a new recipe, or the ability to change a particular recipe.
